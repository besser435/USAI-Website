        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
            Twice per month, USAI will sell lottery tickets. 
            Each player can buy as many tickets as they wish. The jackpot is 
            funded by ticket sales, and will occasionally have a bonus 
            that USAI adds.

        <p><em>How are winners selected?</em></p>
        <code style="text-align: center">
            entries = [entry["username"] for entry in entries for _ in range(entry["entries"])]<br>
            winner = random.choice(entries)
        </code>

        <p><em>What is the USAI Bonus?</em></p>
        <p>
            The USAI Bonus is additional money added to the jackpot by USAI at no cost to ticket holders.
            This is to incentivize people to buy tickets due to the larger jackpot.
        </p>

        <p><em>How much of the jackpot does the winner get?</em></p>
        <p>
            The winner is entitled to no less than 85% of the jackpot. The remaining funds are reserved for USAI to use
            as we see fit. They will mainly to expand the jackpot for future drawings, or for other USAI projects that
            benefit the public.
